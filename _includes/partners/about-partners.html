        <p>Everything we do at DCSIL is highly experiential. We believe the only way to appreciate the relentless demands of entrepreneurship is to operate within a true-to-life environment. This begins with disciplinary diversity—inviting students from across the University of Toronto to collaborate—and is supported by our parallel Dual-Track curriculum: The Business of Software (Customer Development) and the Capstone Design course (Product Development).</p>

        <p>Our partnership model replaces theoretical hallucinations with industry ground truth. We source problem sets directly from sector leaders—challenges that are currently impacting their businesses financially or reputationally every single day.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li class="my-2">You are not solving make-believe issues. You are tasked with deconstructing a partner's problem statement to validate customer personas, identify hair-burning pain points, and iterate toward a self-sustaining business model.</li>
          <li class="my-2">This provides a behind-the-curtain view into systemic challenges that may appear trivial on the surface but reveal immense technical friction upon execution.</li>
          <li class="my-2">By pressure-testing your MVP against the scrutiny of veteran industry stakeholders, you are forced to navigate the delivery standards of the global tech landscape. You aren't just earning a grade; you are building the resilience of a founder.</li>

        <p>In the professional world, founders and engineers rarely have total autonomy over a problem statement. Learning to innovate within specific boundaries is a core component of the DCSIL Protocol.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li class="my-2">When an industry partner is assigned to a term, teams must work strictly within the provided problem statement. You cannot select or pivot to projects outside of this scoped area.</li>
          <li class="my-2">While the partner defines the what and the why, your team is responsible for the how. You must ideate the business logic, the monetization strategy, and the technical architecture.</li>
          <li class="my-2">In terms where a specific industry partner is not present, the teaching team acts as the primary stakeholder, defining the scope and areas of work to ensure every project remains marketable and viable.</li>
