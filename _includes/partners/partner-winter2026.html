      <div class="col-12">
        <p>We are partnering with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/telus-ai-accelerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TELUS AI Accelerator</a> to explore the critical intersection of generative AI innovation and ethical responsibility. The theme for this term will be to build a startup addressing the challenges and opportunities in responsible generative AI development and deployment.</p>
        
        <p>Generative AI is everywhere. The opportunities are endless, as demonstrated by various applications at TELUS. However, there is also the potential for harm, especially for vulnerable and marginalized groups of people. For example, recently, it was discovered that Grok allows users to generate images of people (mostly minors and women) in "minimal clothing". Many questions arise out of this incident, such as consent, ownership of original images as well as overall questions about ethics and legality.</p>
        
        <p>This partnership will challenge students to think critically about how we can harness the power of generative AI while ensuring safety, ethics, and responsible deployment. Students will work on developing solutions that address these complex challenges while creating value for organizations like TELUS.</p>
