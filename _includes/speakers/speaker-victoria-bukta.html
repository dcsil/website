        <p>Victoria Bukta is currently a Member of Product Staff at Databricks, a data and AI company. While she doesn't have a formal title, her role is essentially that of a Product Manager. You might be curious why a product manager is teaching this course—Victoria has a technical background, and her current role in Product has equipped her with a unique skill set to bring technical products to market.</p>
        
        <p>Prior to joining Databricks, Victoria held positions as a Staff Engineer and later an Engineering Manager at Shopify, where she gained experience in leading and developing technical projects within data engineering. She then transitioned to Tabular, a startup founded by the creators of the Apache Iceberg project (which originated at Netflix), where she served as a Product Manager until the company's acquisition in 2024.</p>

        <p>As an alumnus of the University of Toronto, Victoria specialized in Computer Science, with a keen interest in AI and Operating Systems. Her background in operating systems provides a unique perspective within the big data landscape; she believes every challenge in this space can be viewed as a systems problem, solvable by breaking it down into core algorithms and methodologies learned in theoretical courses.</p>
        
        <p>Having been a student in CSC 491 and a TA years ago, Victoria is excited to return and incorporate her product background into the course. Her journey from technical roles to product management gives her a comprehensive understanding of both the engineering and business aspects of building successful products.</p>
        
        <p>Victoria's unique combination of technical depth and product management experience makes her an ideal instructor for students looking to understand how to bridge the gap between building technical products and successfully bringing them to market.</p>
