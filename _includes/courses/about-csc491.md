This capstone project is delivered by industry practitioners from the software and technology sectors. The course integrates knowledge from various disciplines—including software engineering, project management, and data science—within a startup framework. You are expected to be proficient in software development and prepared to learn new technologies independently as project requirements evolve.

Students work in interdisciplinary teams to define, develop, and present a functional proof of concept for a marketable startup. While class time is primarily dedicated to project execution, it includes specialized lectures and technical mentorship. You will work in a high-stakes, interactive environment alongside teammates from CSC454/2527, who provide the strategic and business direction for the product.

This course is a co-requisite of CSC454/2527. The engineering and business workstreams are interdependent; technical decisions must be informed by market research, and business models must be validated by functional code. You are expected to adapt to modern technology stacks and software paradigms autonomously. While mentorship is provided, the ability to research and implement solutions to technical bottlenecks is a non-negotiable requirement.

**Recommended Skills and Experience:** While the specific technical requirements change based on the semester's theme, students should possess a strong foundation in general software engineering. You are not expected to be an expert in every area, but you must be prepared to contribute to your team in several of the following capacities:

<ul>
  <li class="my-2">Web and Mobile Development: Proficiency in modern frontend and backend frameworks.</li>
  <li class="my-2">Data Systems: Experience with data modeling, databases, or machine learning applications.</li>
  <li class="my-2">Infrastructure: Familiarity with cloud services, production environments, and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
  <li class="my-2">Professional Experience: While a PEY or internship is not required, professional experience provides a beneficial foundation for the pace of this course.</li>
</ul>

The choice of specific frameworks and languages rests with the individual teams. The teaching staff does not prescribe technologies, but will provide guidance on the architectural viability of your choices. Any technical decision reached during 1-1 consultations or team meetings must be documented in your GitHub Issues to be recognized for grading.
